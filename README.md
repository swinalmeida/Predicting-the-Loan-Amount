# **Predicting the Loan Amount**
In this repository, I work with data from Lending Club where we try to predict the loan amount to be sanctioned by any lending organization to a member based on the member's previous public and private loan history.

Lending Club is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.

Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders.

Therefore, we will be working on exploring and crunching out the driving factors behind the loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

###About The Dataset:

The file containing loan data through the "present" contains complete loan data for all loans issued through the previous completed calendar quarter. Additional features include credit scores, number of finance inquiries, and collections among others. The file is a matrix of about 39 thousand observations and 111 variables.
